                                User (Customer): Hi, I need some help with setting a monthly budget in Faida.

                                System (Faida Support Bot): Hello üëã Thank you for reaching out! I'd be happy to help you set a monthly budget in Faida. Could you please confirm if you have already linked your bank account with the app?

                                User: Yes, I have linked my bank account already.

                                System: Great! üòä Setting a monthly budget will help you track and manage your spending easily. Here‚Äôs how you can do it:

                                1Ô∏è‚É£ Open the Faida app and go to the Budget section on the home screen.
                                2Ô∏è‚É£ Tap on Create New Budget.
                                3Ô∏è‚É£ Select the category you want to set a budget for (like Food, Transport, Shopping, etc.), or you can select Overall Monthly Budget.
                                4Ô∏è‚É£ Enter the amount you wish to allocate for the month.
                                5Ô∏è‚É£ Tap Save.

                                Once set, Faida will automatically track your transactions and show you your spending progress for that category or overall budget.

                                User: Will Faida send me alerts if I cross my budget?

                                System: Yes! üì≤

                                Faida will automatically notify you when you reach 80% of your budget and again if you cross 100% of it. This helps you control your expenses without stress. You can also adjust or reset your budget anytime from the same Budget section.

                                User: Okay, sounds good. Is there a way to see which category I am overspending in?

                                System: Absolutely!

                                On your Faida home screen, tap on Insights or Expenses Breakdown. You will see a pie chart and list showing:

                                ‚úÖ How much you‚Äôve spent in each category this month.
                                ‚úÖ Which categories are taking most of your budget.
                                ‚úÖ Suggestions on where you can reduce expenses.

                                This will help you identify overspending and adjust your habits accordingly.

                                User: I see. Is there any way to export this data for my records?

                                System: Yes, you can export your expense and budget data as a CSV file. Here‚Äôs how:

                                1Ô∏è‚É£ Go to Settings in the Faida app.
                                2Ô∏è‚É£ Tap on Export Data.
                                3Ô∏è‚É£ Choose the period you want to export (monthly, last 3 months, custom).
                                4Ô∏è‚É£ Select Export as CSV.

                                The file will be sent to your registered email, and you can open it in Excel or Google Sheets to review your spending in detail.

                                User: Nice! Is my data safe on Faida?

                                System: Your data security is our top priority üîí.
